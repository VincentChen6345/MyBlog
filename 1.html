<p style ="font-family:Arial" id = "p1"> Hey there! Thanks for checking out my blog. Before I  talk about how I'm going to change the world and all of my big crazy plans for the future, let's talk about who I am. </p>

<p style ="font-family:Arial" id="p2"> So, who am I? I'm a regular 23 year old (turning 24) Chinese  kid from Sydney, Australia. My parents migrated here in the late 90s. Growing up, I had the whole Asian upbringing spiel thrown at me -  study hard, get in a good high school, study hard at uni, be a doctor/lawyer/engineer, get a job, get a house, get married, have kids, make sure your kids don't destroy the world and your life purpose is complete! Except things never go according to plan do they? My parents thought they had my whole life planned out except they miscalculated one thing... me.</p> 

<p style ="font-family:Arial" id="p3"> As a kid, I had huge unconventional dreams and wild ambitions for the future. At age 14 in 2011, I started my first Youtube channel "VincentChen12" about Beyblades (yes, those spinning top toys). Youtube was still a fresh and young platform at the time. The thought of making money off Youtube really intrigued me and I decided it would be the start of my entrepreneurial endeavors. Unfortunately I got made fun of during high school (some yr9 kids can be real assholes) and I deleted that channel. </p>

<p style ="font-family:Arial" id="p4">In 2015, after graduating high school and starting my civil engineering degree(which I hated) at uni, I watched this Chinese competitive singing show called 'The Voice of China' and I was amazed by the talent and skill of Chinese singers. That is when I discovered and became a fan of Jay Chou, the king of Mandopop. Chinese pop music had inspired me so much that I decided I wanted to be a pro singer. I began practising vocal warmups, vocal techniques and I even recorded my singing on a Chinese karaoke app. Unfortunately, those dreams were instantly shattered in a few months when I finally learned about voice types. I'm a baritone, the average low male voice type and I discovered that every single male pop singer is a tenor, the high male voice type. No matter how much I improved my voice and range, my natural vocal range will always be lower than a tenor's range hence it is literally impossible for me to sing high notes like a tenor (imagine Vin Diesel trying to sing 'Titanium' by Sia).  </p>

<p style ="font-family:Arial" id = "p5">Having your dreams crushed because you weren't born with the natural talent really sucks but you eventually moved on. I renewed my passion to make Youtube videos again in 2019 when I met one of my best friends, Matt. I met Matt on an online course that taught us how to make viral Youtube videos. Matt and I instantly clicked because we had one thing in common - we wanted to attain freedom. We also shared a common interest in self-development and so we started a Youtube channel together called "Above Average Asian". This channel aimed to help socially anxious young men be more confident and our video format was street interviews, similar to Jimmy Zhang and Asian Boss.  </p>

<p style ="font-family:Arial" id="p6" >We actually saw  some traction on our videos, our video "Does Height Matter" has gained over 115k views, another video "Do girls like guys who watch anime?" has over 600k views on Tik Tok and we grew our channel to over 1000 subs in just 1 year. Heck, we even made a solid $25 off of Youtube. Despite the traction, we realised after one year that we weren't cut out to be entertainers after all. I personally couldn't see myself making street interviews at age 30, 40, 50... yikes. So after a bit of contemplation and some tough conversations we decided to move on from making viral videos on Youtube and we entered the start-up world.</p>

<p style ="font-family:Arial" id="p7">This blog isn't meant to talk about our start-up journey, for that you can watch our vlogs on our Youtube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN2IwCSxashOG-3kvkOtS7A"> Above Average Asian</a>. Basically, we came up with a cool idea for a dating/friending app however neither of us knew how to code. This is what led me to find Coder Academy and my newest passion, web development.  </p>

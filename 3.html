<p class="paragraphs">
  I WORK AT GOOGLE... well not quite but I did create a replica of Google's home page using my base knowledge of HTML and CSS and with the help of the Internet. Take a look.

<p class="paragraphs">Not bad for a beginner 1 month into coding if you ask me. I've read that the best way to understand coding is to apply it to small projects like this Google page (and my blog itself). I want to talk about some key challenges and lessons I've learned from this project. </p>

<h2 class="subheader">1. You will forget things and that's okay. </h2>

<p class="paragraphs"> I have completed a free online course introducing me to HTML and CSS. Going through the course, I found it quite easy to understand how to use HTML and CSS. It's just a bunch of tags and syntax. However, when I started this making this page, the only things I remembered were the heading tags < h > and paragraph tags < p >. I forgot everything else. That sounds bad but the reality is that as long as you understand how to use the basics of HTML and CSS, you can simply Google search the syntax for everything else. This brings me to my next point...
</p>

<h2 class="subheader">2. GOOGLE IS A GODSEND</h2>
<p class="paragraphs">Thank god for Google, Stackoverflow, W3schools and every other forum that teaches coding. Tutorials don't teach you everything you need to know about HTML or any other language. When it comes to more complex features, you're on your own. For example, I wanted to make a navbar (the bar that says 'Home', 'News' , 'Contact' and 'About') but it's not included in the tutorial. What did I do? I Google searched 'how to create a navbar in html' and found a solution from StackOverflow. I've heard from many software engineers on Youtube that the no.1 key to success is your ability to find your own solutions by utilising resources on the Internet. If you rely too heavily on tutorials, you don't develop the skills and confidence to learn new things on your own. </p>

<h2 class="subheader">3. The Devil is in the detail</h2>
<p class="paragraphs"> I've been coding for about 1 month now and the one thing that has frustrated me the most is when you seemingly wrote down the code word for word off stackoverflow and yet your page doesn't look the way it should. You pull your hair out trying to figure out why it's not working. Then after 30min you realise you forgot a comma in your code. The devil is in the detail and if your code has one mistake, one typo, one extra space- it could drive you nuts trying to find it. One thing I've tried is to delete the segment of the code that isn't working and then try writing it out line by line and running the code after I add a new line of code to see where the problem lies. 

<p class="paragraphs">
  Overall, creating this Google page was really fun! If you're a beginner web developer like me, I highly recommend trying this out yourself! It took about 2.5 days to complete. I've already begun learning my next language and this one's a real challenge- Javascript.

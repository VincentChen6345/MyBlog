<h2 id= h2> My first experience with HTML and CSS</h2>


<p id=p1> During my 4th year of university back in 2018, I joined a student comedy sketch show called 'UNSW CSE REVUE'. 'CSE' stands for computer science engineering and a 'revue' is a comedic performance consisting of singing, acting and dancing (yes, I can sing, act and dance). <br><br>Besides the shits and giggles, I had the opportunity to make some computer science friends and had a look at their coding projects. When I saw their code, my first thought was "my brain is about to FKING EXPLODE!" Needless to say, the thought of me writing code was equivalent to throwing a cat into the ocean. 

<br> 
<br>
Yet here I am, 6 years later, making my personal blog page from scratch. I completed a free course on HTML and CSS by Zenva Academy (thanks btw) and now I'm putting theory into practice step by step. 

<br><br>

Let me summarise what I've learned so far. HTML stands for 'HyperText Markup Language', it's where you generate the 'content' of your website e.g. text, titles, paragraph, images etc. 
<br><br>
<b>How does HTML work?</b>
<br><br>
HTML requires you to use tags to communicate what you want to create. You place these tags at the start and end of your content, like the bread of a sandwich and your content is the filling. For example, <span style = "color:blue">< h > < /h > </span> is a simple header tag. 

<br><br>

If I write a code like this : 

<br><br>
<span style="color:blue"> 
< h > My first website < /h > 
</span>


<br><br>
this means that 'My first website' is a header. 
<br><br>
That's basically how HTML works, now just go and find all the different types of tags you need to do different things! Not too complicated right?



<br><br>
<b>What is CSS?</b>
<br><br>
CSS stands for 'cascading style sheets', it allows you to edit the design of your page. You can change things like text colour, size, font, position and more. Basically it makes your website pretty. Without CSS, your HTML will also look pretty... pretty boring (I like puns). 

<br><br>

Here's a picture of this webpage without any CSS. 

</p>
<br><br>


<div>
<img id=pic1
 src= "raw.png"
 width: 80%;
  height: 80%;

/>
</div>

<p id=par2>
<br><br> 
I created this page by first writing all of my content with HTML and then designing and styling it with CSS until you have what you currently see. The CSS code looks something like this.   
</p>


<img id=css src="rawcss.png">


<p id=par3>
<br><br>
Now although this may look complicated, it actually follows a simple set of rules. The challenge is learning how to do the specific things you want to do and that involves a lot of Google. 
<br><br>

6 years ago, I thought coding was too hard for me. Now I realise how important it is to at least give things a try and remain open-minded. Ever since I completed the free HTML + CSS course, I've realised 2 things: 1. this is pretty fun and 2. I <b><u>CAN</u></b> do this.
